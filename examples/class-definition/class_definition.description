// Classes describe an object type and provide a way to construct values of that type. <br/>
// Objects are a behaviourial type. An object is a combination of public, private, and module-level visible fields along with a
// set of associated functions (called methods) that can be used to manipulate the fields. This allows you
// to define custom-behavioural data types. <br/>
// A class can have an `init` method that gets called when creating an object using the `new` expression.
// The return type of the`init` method should be a subtype of `error?` containing `()`. If the `init` method execution
// returns an error, the `new` expression will return the error.
