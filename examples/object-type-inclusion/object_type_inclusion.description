// Type inclusions in a class or object provide a way to copy the members from a class or object
// into another class or object. It is equivalent to declaring the members explicitly
// within the new class/object, thus, eliminating redundancy. A class/object can have
// zero or more type inclusions.
// Fields and method definitions can override included fields and methods
// provided that they are sub-types of included field/method types.
