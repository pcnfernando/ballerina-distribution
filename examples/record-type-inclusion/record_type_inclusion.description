// Record type inclusion provides a convenient way to copy the fields defined in a record type descriptor
// to another record type descriptor. It is equivalent to explicitly defining those fields in the new type descriptor.
// If the record being included has fields with explicitly-assigned default values, those values would also be
// copied. A record type descriptor can have multiple type inclusions.
// Type inclusion applies to both open and closed records. In open records, the rest field is not considered for
// type inclusion in open records.
